The site remains in use by the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian Church to this day, and it remains an important place of pilgrimage for Ethiopian Orthodox worshipers. It took 24 years to build all the 11 rock hewn churches. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-Hewn_Churches,_Lalibela">Read more...</a>

The region's capital is Assosa. Following the adoption of the 1995 constitution, the region was created from the westernmost portion of the Gojjam province (the part north of the Abay River), and the northwestern portion of the Welega Province (the part south of the Abay). The name of the region comes from two peoples – Berta (also called Benishangul) and Gumuz.</p>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benishangul-Gumuz_Region">Read more...</a>
